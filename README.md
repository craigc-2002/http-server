# http_server
## Basic HTTP Server
Very basic minimalist HTTP server. Based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HrYIl6GpYg) by Nir Lichtman, and extended by Craig Cochrane.

It has no security or error checking, so don't use it.

## To Do
- remove debugging output and add proper logging
- Limit files that can be served (maybe add a set folder that is searched for files)
- Server runs continously until process stopped
- build directory for build artifacts
- update readme
